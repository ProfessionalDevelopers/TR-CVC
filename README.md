# TR-CVC

A very basic drum machine and bassline synthesizer, based incredibly loosely on the Roland TR-303, TR-909 and TB-808 machines.

This was built entirely through interaction with OpenAI's ChatGPT, specifically using GPT-4's Code Intepretation module.

The goal was to build a drum machine with reatlime editing capabilities, combined with the ability to add additional sounds and sequencing modes.

# Features:
- Simple 16-step sequencer: press space to toggle a step, and on bass and piano lines, repeat it to choose a different note.
- Bad approxmiations of classic roland 808 and 909 sounds: Bass Drum, Snare, Low- Mid- and High-Toms, Clap, Cowbell, Hihat and Open Hihat
- A simplistic bassline sequencer allowing octave jumps of a square wav
- Configurable highpass filter for the bass sequence
- A ...piano(?) sound. Another sound.
- Swing (currently broken)
- Per-channel mute and un-mutes
- Change kits while playing
- Pre-set mixer levels (in code)
- Automatic save and restore of sequences
